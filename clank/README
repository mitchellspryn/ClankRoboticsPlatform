Clank: An open-source, robust robotic platform

Legal disclaimer: I am reasonably sure that the code provided in this package is bug-free and non-malicious, but use at your own risk. Don't yell at me if your toaster starts attacking you after a build.

==DEPENDENCIES==
This project depends on the following packages:
build-essential
cmake

It also includes the following packages
gtest
mjpeg-streamer

==BUILD INSTRUCTIONS==

If the hardware daemon has been changed (anything inside of SAM/):
1) Make sure you have the udoo-arduino-build cli application. If you don't download it from here and install: https://github.com/TomFreudenberg/udoo-arduino-cli
2) cd into the SAM directory and run:
  $./makeAndUpload.sh

For the first build ever:
1) cd into /lib/module/VideoStreamer/mjpeg-streamer
2) build the script using the README

For normal code builds (ARM only):
1) cd into robot
2) type the following commands:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
3) Once the build finishes (there should be no warnings), you can run the unit tests using the following commands:
  cd bin
  ./RunAllUnitTests.sh

4) Ensure that the config is correct in /config/TeleoperatedRobot.config
5) To run the backend, from the build directory run the command
  ./bin/StartTeleoperatedRobot ../config/TeleoperatedRobot.config

6) Start the frontend client. If successful, you should see the webcam stream.
